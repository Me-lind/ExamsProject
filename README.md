Course Registration and Grading System
This project aims to develop a course registration and grading system for a university. The system will enable students to register for courses, lecturers to enter grades, and administrators to generate reports.

FEATURES
Student Registration: Students can register for up to 5 courses per semester.

Grade Entry: Lecturers can enter 2 ASSIGNMENTS, 2 CATS and 1 Exam score for each registered student.

Reports: Administrators can generate reports showing:

Students who have passed all courses in a semester or year.
Students who have failed one or more courses in a semester or year.
Students who were not able to do examinations due to school fees or medical reasons.
Students who do not have marks in at least one course.
Students who registered but are missing marks in all courses.
Students who are attempting a course for the second time.
A summary of all marks scored per course (per semester and per year) per student for a class.
SECURITY
Lecturers cannot edit marks once they have been entered.
Only administrators can edit marks.
Implementation
The system is implemented using firebase firestore database to store student registration data, grades, and reports.
